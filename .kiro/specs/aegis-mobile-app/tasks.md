## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation at key milestones
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties (25 properties total from design)
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The design uses TypeScript throughout — all implementation uses TypeScript with strict mode
